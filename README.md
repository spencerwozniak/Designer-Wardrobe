Took in inputs of clothes that the user had, and used these pictures to give outfit ideas prompted to the user. If the user liked the idea "Yes" was selected adding the picture to a list, if "No" was selected then the outfit would not be added to a list. 

Using this list with the outfits that the user clicked "Yes" on, this data was then input into DALL-E from Openai and it would then develop an idea based on the outfits that the user liked.

The outfit that was generated would then appear on the screen for the user to be prompted "Yes" or "No" as well, outfits would continue to generate until the user clicked "Yes" on the DALL-E generated outfit.
